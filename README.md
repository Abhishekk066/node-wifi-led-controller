## 💻 Software Requirements

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **Arduino IDE** (for ESP32 programming)
- **ESP32 Board Package** for Arduino IDE
- **Google Gemini API Key** (for AI chatbot functionality)

## 🔧 Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abhi0065/node-wifi-led-controller.git
cd node-wifi-led-controller
```

### 2. Install Node.js Dependencies

```bash
cd led
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `led` directory:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
PORT=3000
```

### 4. ESP32 Setup

1. Open `wifi_led.ino` in Arduino IDE
2. Install ESP32 board package if not already installed
3. Update WiFi credentials in the code:
   ```cpp
   const char* ssid = "Your_WiFi_Name";
   const char* password = "Your_WiFi_Password";
   ```
4. Upload the code to your ESP32

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Network Configuration

The application automatically detects your WiFi network and configures the ESP32 with a static IP address (`192.168.X.50` where X is your network subnet).

### Circuit Connections

- **LED 1**: GPIO 27 → LED → 220Ω Resistor → GND
- **LED 2**: GPIO 26 → LED → 220Ω Resistor → GND

## 🎯 Usage

### 1. Start the Server

```bash
cd led
npm start
```

### 2. Access the Web Interface

Open your browser and navigate to:
- `http://localhost:3000` (if running locally)
- `http://[your-computer-ip]:3000` (for network access)

### 3. Control LEDs

- Use toggle switches to turn LEDs on/off
- Enable blinking mode for dynamic LED patterns
- Real-time status updates across all connected devices

### 4. AI Voice Commands

Click the "Ask Alexa" button and use voice commands:
- "LED 1 on" / "LED 1 off"
- "Blink LED 2" / "Stop blinking LED 2"
- "Turn on all lights" / "Turn off all lights"
- Hindi commands: "LED 1 चालू" / "LED 1 बंद"

## 🌐 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/on1` | Turn on LED 1 |
| POST | `/off1` | Turn off LED 1 |
| POST | `/on2` | Turn on LED 2 |
| POST | `/off2` | Turn off LED 2 |
| POST | `/blink-on1` | Start blinking LED 1 |
| POST | `/blink-off1` | Stop blinking LED 1 |
| POST | `/blink-on2` | Start blinking LED 2 |
| POST | `/blink-off2` | Stop blinking LED 2 |
| POST | `/res` | AI chatbot endpoint |

## 🗣️ AI Voice Commands

### English Commands
- Basic control: "LED [1/2] on/off"
- Blinking: "Blink LED [1/2]", "Stop blinking LED [1/2]"
- Bulk control: "Turn on all lights", "Turn off all lights"
- Alternative terms: "light", "bulb" (instead of "LED")

### Hindi Commands (हिंदी)
- Basic control: "LED [1/2] चालू/बंद"
- Bulk control: "सभी LED चालू/बंद"
